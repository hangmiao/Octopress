#Background
If you often see something on webpage and want to do a Google search of it, then this addon could be a huge time saver.

It is basically a Firefox addon to quickly search for selected texts on a
     webpage. So you don't have to "copy, moving to the search box in the
browser, paste, and hit `enter`". Instead you can just select the texts and then press
some keyboard shortcuts. This add-on will open up a new tab and show the search engine results.

I used to live without it until one day I had to do some quite intensive searching.
Having to repeatedly following that cumbersome procedure kinda drove me crazy.
So I googled it and it turned out, in this day and age, there isn't a
quick way to do it! Then I decided to write my own. It works quite well and now I
can't live without it. 

If you are stilling struggling with this kinda issue, hope this will help you too!

#Usage
1. Install this [Search Selected Shortcuts addon][addon-link] (no need to restart).
2. Select the text you want to search on a webpage.
3. Press some keyboard shortcuts:
    * **`alt + s`**: google search the selected text
    * **`alt + q`**: google search the selected text, but also put them in double quotes.  
       E.g. you've selected, `theory of everything`, then it will do a search of `"theory of everything"`
    * **`alt + c`**: google search the selected text, but only search in the current site. 
       E.g. if you are on `stackoverflow.com`, the search would be like, `hackish site:stackoverflow.com`
    * **`alt + i`**: google image search
    * **`alt + w`**: wikipedia search the selected text
4. Eureka!
